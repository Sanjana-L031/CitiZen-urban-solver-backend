# CitiZen-urban-solver-backend
Flask-based backend for the Citizen Urban Solver project, providing APIs for issue reporting, user management, and analytics. This service powers the frontend platform where citizens can report urban issues such as potholes, waste management, and streetlight failures, and enables city authorities to monitor and resolve them efficiently.
